- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

- Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
